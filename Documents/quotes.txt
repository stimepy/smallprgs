"One of the old-timer members, a military veteran, went on to a successful career and became financially independent in the early 1980s. 
He decided to stop working, but he was concerned about setting a good example for his teenage daughter so he decided to demonstrate the
virtues of work. Each morning he’d get up, shave, dress up in coat & tie, and be at the breakfast table to greet her as she got ready for
school. He’d drive off “for work” before she caught the school bus. He’d hang out at the local coffee shop until she was clear, and then 
he’d return home to change clothes and enjoy his retirement day his way. This continued until she left for college.

Two decades later he confessed this subterfuge to his adult daughter, and she laughed at him. She said that she’d never noticed what he 
was doing because she was too totally wrapped up in her teenage life (with its drama & angst) to notice what her Dad was doing with his
time. She said that even if she’d noticed, she was still too busy with her own drama & angst to care. She never noticed or cared what
kind of employment example he was setting. All she really cared about was him being there when she needed him.

Lawful Nice = Whatever toys you asked for

Chaotic Nice = Educational toys
Lawful Neutral = Toys meant to promote socializing
True Neutral = "Pharmacy toy aisle" toys
Chaotic Neutral = Toys that aren't flammable
Lawful Naughty = Socks and underwear
Neutral Naughty = Coal
Chaotic Naughty = Krampus
